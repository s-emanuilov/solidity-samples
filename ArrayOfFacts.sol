/* Simple contract in Solidity that keeps in the blockchain a string array of facts. 
There must be a function that checks whether the user that tries to add new facts is authorized to do so. 
Furthermore, the contract must have two additional functions â€“ one to return the length of the array 
and the other to return a fact that occupies a certain place in the array */
